Everywhere we went, there was always someone \(verb1.text!) behind me. It all felt so real until I looked into the mirror. It wasnâ€™t me at all! Instead, it was \(name2.text!)! After that, I immediately woke up. 'Phew, glad that is over.' Or at least I thought! My mom had turned into a \(noun2.text!)! I reached to the side of my bed for my trusty \(noun3.text!) thinking it would save my mom. Just as I was about to use it, my mom woke me up for breakfast. 'Are you okay? You look \(adjetive2.text!).' I hugged her and said 'Yeah, just peachy.'"

We are \(adjetive1.text!) but cannot understand why they do not come into our kitchen where we have traps set, as they come into the kitchens of \(name1.text!). Although we are pleased, we are also upset, because the \(noun1.text!) behave as though there were something wrong with our kitchen. What makes this even more puzzling is that our house is much less tidy than the houses of our neighbors. There is more food \(verb1.text!) about in our kitchen, more crumbs on the counters and filthy scraps of \(noun2.text!) kicked against the base of the cabinets. In fact, there is so much loose food in the kitchen I can only think \(name2.text!) themselves are defeated by it. In a \(adjetive2.text!) kitchen, it is a challenge for them to find enough food night after night to survive until spring. They patiently hunt and nibble hour after hour until they are satisfied. In the \(noun3.text!), however, they are faced with something so out of proportion to their experience that they cannot deal with it. They might venture out a few steps, but soon the overwhelming sights and smells drive them back into their holes, uncomfortable and embarrassed at not being able to scavenge as they should."
